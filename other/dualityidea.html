                    <p>This character I made in a day or so was the result of a dream after playing a tad bit too much

                    <p>After having the dream, I wrote quite a bit of the character, abilities, just some fanmade little
                        ideas.</p>
                    <p>Below is what I wrote:</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="body-txt">
                <p><strong>Killer:</strong> Duality</p>
                <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> black and white limbs, split down the middle in color, it has a tie and
                    a hat on their person and their head is also split into two colors</p>
                <p>Duality has two signature swords that he keeps at his waists when not in use at all times, one white,
                    one black, these swords are Duality’s soul, as if there’s anymore of that anyway, if either of these
                    swords are destroyed, Duality may not exist to see it be that way.</p>
                <p>Duality is a being that once was a player, though after years of torment, disregard, and abuse, his
                    death released all of the pent up anger and resentment he had to the citizens of Roblox in the form
                    of an entity.</p>
                <p>Before being known as the feared entity Duality, he was known as David, someone who kept quiet and
                    was commonly made fun of, shamed, disregarded, and ignored, which be the case of Dualities violent
                    tendencies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stats">
                <p><strong>Stats:</strong></p>
                <p>Cost - 1850</p>
                <p>Difficulty - 5</p>
                <p>Damage - 95</p>
                <p>Health - 925</p>
                <p>Regular Speed - 8.25</p>
                <p>Sprinting Speed - 28</p>
                <p>Stamina - 110</p>
                <p>Stamina Loss Per Second - 10</p>
                <p>Stamina Gain Per Second - 20</p>
                <p>Duality can build up massive damage at the cost of time, meaning charging up a powerful attack is
                    slow but impactful.</p>

                                    placed in the ground, survivors can spend 10 seconds pulling the sword out of the

                                    On the second time that this ability is called, Duality will aim his other sword at

                                    sword, the sword in the ground will cause a large shockwave of misery across a 15

                                    stance for 1.5 seconds, during this stance, Duality is inflicted with Slowness V,
                                    removed once he is no longer in the defensive stance. If attacked during this
                                    period, he negates the incoming damage and automatically counters with a strike that
                                    inflicts Tormented I for 8 seconds. This counter deals 125% of Duality’s normal
                                    damage. If no attack is received, the cooldown is reduced by 50% and Duality is
                                    inflicted with Slowness I for 2 seconds.</td>
