                        <p>This character I made in a day or so was the result of a dream after playing a tad bit too much of <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/18687417158/DUSEKKAR-Forsaken" target="_blank" class="hover-link">Forsaken</a>.</p>
                        <p>After having the dream, I wrote quite a bit of the character, abilities, just some fanmade little ideas.</p>
                        <p>Below is what I wrote:</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="body-txt">
                    <p><strong>Killer:</strong> Duality</p>
                    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> black and white limbs, split down the middle in color, it has a tie and a hat on their person and their head is also split into two colors</p>
                    <p>Duality has two signature swords that he keeps at his waists when not in use at all times, one white, one black, these swords are Duality’s soul, as if there’s anymore of that anyway, if either of these swords are destroyed, Duality may not exist to see it be that way.</p>
                    <p>Duality is a being that once was a player, though after years of torment, disregard, and abuse, his death released all of the pent up anger and resentment he had to the citizens of Roblox in the form of an entity.</p>
                    <p>Before being known as the feared entity Duality, he was known as David, someone who kept quiet and was commonly made fun of, shamed, disregarded, and ignored, which be the case of Dualities violent tendencies.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="stats">
                    <p><strong>Stats:</strong></p>
                    <p>Cost - 1850</p>
                    <p>Difficulty - 5</p>
                    <p>Damage - 95</p>
                    <p>Health - 925</p>
                    <p>Regular Speed - 8.25</p>
                    <p>Sprinting Speed - 28</p>
                    <p>Stamina - 110</p>
                    <p>Stamina Loss Per Second - 10</p>
                    <p>Stamina Gain Per Second - 20</p>
                    <p>Duality can build up massive damage at the cost of time, meaning charging up a powerful attack is slow but impactful.</p>

    On the second time that this ability is called, Duality will aim his other sword at the sword in the ground, with a delay based off of distance from Duality and his sword, the sword in the ground will cause a large shockwave of misery across a 15 stud radius. Any player caught by this shockwave is given Slowness II and Tormented II for 10 seconds max, the closer the player is to the sword once it causes a shockwave, the longer the effect will take place. Once the sword causes the shockwave, it returns to Duality.</td>

If attacked during this period, he negates the incoming damage and automatically counters with a strike that inflicts Tormented I for 8 seconds. This counter deals 125% of Duality’s normal damage. If no attack is received, the cooldown is reduced by 50% and Duality is inflicted with Slowness I for 2 seconds.</td>
