                  I evaluate whether the idea is fresh, engaging, and truly something that I can help elevate.
                  If it's creative or has something I think I'd like to work on, I'll move forward. If not, I'm always
                  transparent about whether I'm the right fit or if it needs more refinement.

                  After we have a general idea, I’ll get a quick reality check based on what is needed,
                  estimated time to build, and any potential roadblocks. This helps me understand if the project is
                  doable within the desired timeframe and budget.

                  Finally, if everything looks good and we both feel confident, we’ll agree on the details and make a

                  plan to move into development. This includes making deadlines, deliverables,
                  payment structure, and setting up clear communication so there are no surprises later.

                  Before I start building anything, I like to take a bit of time to understand exactly what’s needed.
                  This is like gathering reference, asking questions, research on how it should look (which is way more
                  common than you'd think, for example, researching 6 hours on how helicopters land), and just getting
                  an overall grasp on the vision and scope of the project.
                  It's not just about having a plan, it's about actually setting things up so we’re working smart and
                  not dumb, cause dumb work is bad.

                  I’ll always take a moment here to be honest with myself (and with you) about whether this is something
                  I can do right, because I always try to be as honest as possible with people I work with.
                  Quality matters to me much more than quantity, and I’d rather pass on a project than give you
                  something I’m not confident in.
                  But if I think I can make it great then I'm all in and the process continues.

                  This is where I do all of the work. I’ll create a clean baseplate or place where everything will be
                  made, this is also to protect my work so I can get paid before sending it over.

                  Here’s where the ideas actually start becoming something.
                  I’ll build out a first version of the work and just make sure everything works the way it should. This
                  part is all about function and testing, not perfection.

                <p>
                  Now that we’ve got the actual idea and draft in place, it’s time to go back through and clean things
                  up.
                  I’ll polish the models, scripts, UI, animation, or whatever I’m working on, refining it until it feels
                  right and looks good. This is where a lot of the final look and feel comes together, basically
                  rendering.

                <p>
                  These are the finishing touches like small things that people might not notice or pay attention to at
                  first, but the small things that make the work "feel" better if that makes sense.
                  Whether it’s visuals, transitions, or optimizing how something runs, I always go through and make sure
                  everything is just right but not glorified.

                  At this point, everything’s been tested, cleaned up, and ready to go. I’ll do a final review, confirm
                  it meets the goals you or I set, and make sure you're happy with the results.

                  If we're working on a per asset payment setup, this is when that gets sorted out. I like to keep this
                  process straightforward and fair, with clear communication so we’re both on the same page about what’s
                  been delivered and what’s owed.

                <p>
                  Once everything’s final and paid (if pay per asset is used), I’ll get the work properly imported into
                  your game that it was made for.
                  I’ll double-check that everything is placed correctly and runs as expected in the live setting.
                  From here, the work is owned by you and you can do whatever you want with it.
