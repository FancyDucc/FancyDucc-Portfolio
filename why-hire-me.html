                                <h4 class="text-uppercase" style="color: #5000e6;">Proven Expertise</h4>
                                <p>I bring over 9 years of experience to the world of Roblox game development. From scripting, animating, building, UI Design, I've done it all. My ability to adapt to any aspect of a project means you get a developer who's versatile, capable, and ready to remove any challenges in the way. Whether it's making detailed animations or building environments that simply don't look like Roblox, I've proven time and time again that I can get you the quality work that you deserve.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="why-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                                <h4 class="text-uppercase" style="color: #5000e6;">Adaptable and Efficient</h4>
                                <p>I don't just create; I solve problems. Game development is full of unexpected problems, Roblox more than other engines unironically, and I pride myself on being adaptable. If a game needs minor fixing, if a script isn't quite right, or if a build has that look of being "off," I'm the person to sort it out. My approach is all about efficiency, I get the job done with minimal fuss, without sacrificing quality or performance.</p>

                            <li class="why-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                                <h4 class="text-uppercase" style="color: #5000e6;">Ability to Collaborate with a Team</h4>
                                <p>Game development is a team effort 5 times out of 10, and I really really enjoy sharing my skills to many projects. I believe that communication, sharing ideas, and learning from coworkers is what makes a game or any project truly successful. I've collaborated with many fellow developers, studios, and friends on many projects, making sure that we hit milestones while having fun along the way. I thrive in places where my input helps the team create something even better than planned, but if you ask I won't step out of my boundaries and follow the plan that you choose.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="why-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                                <h4 class="text-uppercase" style="color: #5000e6;">Originality</h4>
                                <p>Originality is important, really important. I put effort into making sure that the games I make and input I deliver are as original as possible, unoriginality is detrimental for a game, and the more games that come out the more difficult originality comes to achieving, so I'm here to help with that and make figuring out originality one of those things that is more easy than hard.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="why-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                                <h4 class="text-uppercase" style="color: #5000e6;">Skill in Optimization</h4>
                                <p>One of those things that most games lack is truly good optimization, players love optimization even if they don't know it, even if a game isn't the most wonderful of quality, great optimization can fix that, a bad game can be made good with it, and it's impossible you'll get a bad game when I'm on the team ;)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="why-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                                <h4 class="text-uppercase" style="color: #5000e6;">Commitment to Quality</h4>
                                <p>Every project whether solo or collaborative is a learning experience for me. I make sure my work is polished, and I'm always pushing the concept of making my next project even better than the last. I put a lot of pride into every detail I add, whether it's a piece of scripting or the lighting on a model. Plus, I often seek feedback from those I've worked with to keep improving, all feedback is appreciated, good or bad.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="why-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                                <h4 class="text-uppercase" style="color: #5000e6;">Flexibility with Payment</h4>
                                <p>I understand that each project is unique and each owner is more unique, and I offer flexibility in terms of payment. Whether it's Robux, group funds, or simply a few special permissions, we can work something out that fits your needs and budget. Additionally, I'm open to helping with projects free of charge, provided I believe in the vision and love what you are doing and we're having fun creating something great together.</p>

                                <h4 class="text-uppercase" style="color: #5000e6;">A Proven Track Record</h4>
                                <p>Don’t just take my word for it, I’ve received tons of great feedback from the developers and teams I've worked with. Whether it's adaptability, the quality of my work, or my dedication to finishing projects on time, I’ve proven myself across multiple games, large and small.</p>
